    "In this jupyter notebook, author specifies the Zivot and Andrews (ZA, 1992) models specification for One-endogenous structural break, and Narayan and Popp (NP, 2010) models specification for two-endogenous structural break unit root tests. Firstly, this notebook examines ZA unit root test. This test possesses an ability to determine the unknown break date endogenously within trending data series. However, this test has a limitation where it does not apply the structural break date when test cannot reject the null hypothesis of unit roots. In GAUSS Light 21, there are two different models that can be employed to test for structural breaks within time-series data series for ZA test, _id est_\n",
