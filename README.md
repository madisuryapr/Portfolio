# Projects
This repository is dedicated to showing and storing author's projects. 
Furthermore, it compiles projects regarding Data Science & Analytics, Econometrics Analyses, and Data Visualization
Author utilizes some applications in this folder as follows:

Data Science & Analytics, Econometrics and Data Visualization:
- Python (PyCharm)
- GAUSS Light 21
- Jupyter Notebook

Databases:
- SQL / PostgreSQL 13
- DataGrip 2021

# [Anime List](https://github.com/madisuryapr/Projects/tree/main/Anime%20List)
PostgreSQL Project. In this directory, author compiles 150 random anime series in which encompasses period of 2018 to 2021.
Each year consists of four consecutive seasons, namely Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall. Author compiled 8-10 anime series for each season.
In addition, author created an unique Anime ID number to represent the anime series. For example:
-  20210307041201 for RE-MAIN Anime Series. The representation are as follows:
1. 202103: Year and season of anime. Anime season are classified into:
- 01 = Winter
- 02 = Spring
- 03 = Summer
- 04 = Fall

2. 0704: Month and Date of anime released (July 04), and
3. 1201: Number of Episodes and Seasons of anime itself.

Therefore, this Anime ID indicates that RE-MAIN is released in Summer 2021 on July 04, where it has 12 Episodes in total and only 1 anime season.

# [ADF Structural Break Test with GAUSS Light 21](https://github.com/madisuryapr/Projects/tree/main/ADF%20Structural%20Break%20Test%20with%20GAUSS%20Light%2021)

### Introduction
It is prominent to note that unit root hypothesis promotes both theoretical and empirical implications for economic theory and modeling. Furthermore, ignoring structural break within time-series dataset would lead to false acceptance of null hypothesis of unit root and test statistics could be misleading.This directory objective is to examine the structural breaks within Indonesia's noncash payment systems dataset. By Utilizing GAUSS Light 21, this project conducted Structural Breaks Tests with ADF Approach. There are 2 (two) main literature incorporated in this test:

**1. Zivot and Andrews (1992) Structural Break Test**

This test assumes that one-endogenous break occurs within time-series data. There are two different models within this test:
- Model 1: One Break occurs in Level only, and
- Model 2: One Break occurs in both Level and Trend.

**2. Narayan and Popp (2010) Structural Break Test**

This test allows two-endogenous break occurs within time-series data. Two different models are deployed within this test, namely:
- Model 1: Two Breaks occur in Level only, and
- Model 2: Two Breaks occur in both Level and Trend.
